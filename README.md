# New attack cifar10

New attacks transfers adversarial examples from an ensemble of surrogate models to a black-box victim model.\n
We utilize the feedback from the victim model to adjust the weights attributed to each model in the ensemble.\n
We diversify the surrogate models by applying the property of ghost networks with keeping the same search space dimension.
